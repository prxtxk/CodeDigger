First we chose the two lifts which depends on in which corridor/block the room lies in, like in Test Case-0
the room number was 4 in first test case so the room was in first corridor, so the two best suited lifts to 
use were 1 and 2 to minimize the time. 
Calculations are Easy:
for total time in lift, it is number_of_floors_travelled(floor_number - 1) * length_of_each_floor(10) * speed_of_lift(5).
for total time on foot, it is,
firstly,the interchange period time, which is, no_of_rooms(10) * speed_of_man(1) * distance_bet_rooms(5)
secondly,the period from exiting lift to the room, which is, no_of_rooms_travelled(travel from  that lift from which the room is closest) * speed * distance_bet_rooms

So, the decision of which lift to chose in start depends on the proximity of room to the lifts chosen.
We chose the lift in start which is not close the room, so that on interchanging the lift, the senior is on the closest lift.
And we can get the number of rooms between the lift and room by r=room_no%10, which itself has two conditions,
firstly, if r lies from 1 to 5 than simply we can use it directly.
secondly , if  is from 6 to 9 or 0 than we can get number of rooms by using formula: no_of_rooms = 10 - r + 1   , where 10 is total rooms in corridor.
